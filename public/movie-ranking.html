<h1>The Best Movies According to Dario</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dragon Ball Z</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite anime shows. I watched it when I was a boy.</p>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>Much better story and objectively better in every way, but there will always be something about DBZ.</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>I didn't even watch it, but I needed something to put here. Who actually makes "favourite" movies/TV shows lists? C'mon now.</p>
