<h2>In short:</h2>
<p>
My name is Dario.<br />
I'm from Croatia.<br />
I'm 28 years old.<br />
I'm an English teacher by profession.<br />
Now I'm learning web development.<br />
</p>

<hr />

<p>I graduated from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Rijeka in 2019 with a Master's degree in
English language and literature and pedagogy. I worked as a teacher for a while but found that it doesn't interest me.
I like learning new useful skills, and since I always regretted not studying IT, I decided to learn web development.</p>

<p>I hope that I can become a good developer one day!</p>
